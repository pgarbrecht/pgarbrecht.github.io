     <p>What is a passion? If you ask me, it's something you inherently <u>want</u> to do. There may or may not be a tangible reward for doing it, but doing it is a reward in itself. Passions can grow over time, but it seems they have always been there in some shape or form. Similarly, even if you try to shake them they won't really go away. In this guide, you will learn about my top 5 passions in life and what they reveal about me as a person. Let's jump in!</p>

     <h2><span>#5 Exploring</span></h2>
     <br>

     <p>I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a> in the 90s. Back then, it was a quiet, typical suburb (although now it's a tech hub with quite the party scene). I remember going on many adventures with my friends in local parks, alleyways, and open fields. We never knew what we would find, like a mean old horny toad, which to a kid, looks just like a tiny dinosaur. In retrospect these discoveries were very trivial and commonplace, but it was the act of discovering them that made them so special. I believe these days cultivated a love for adventure that continues to this day with my passion for traveling. Since then, I've enjoyed visiting many places throughout the US. I also lived in Japan for about three years, teaching English there after college. While you will always discover new things in new places, it's the people you meet there that truly stay with you for the rest of your life. I made many wonderful friends in Japan I cherish to this day and met my now wife there. None of that would have happened without going on the adventure.</p>

     <h2><span>#4 Animation and Video Games</span></h2>
     <br>

     <br>
     <p>When I wasn't outside having fun with friends as a kid I was inside watching cartoons or playing video games. Technically animation and video games are two separate categories, but they've both had an equal impact on me and there are many series I've enjoyed that have both animated shows and games, so I'll discuss them together. As a kid I could give you the name, type, and evolution of every Pokemon, played nearly every game on the N64 and Gameboy Color, and loved watching shows on Toonami (which had the "cooler" anime shows kids started watching in late elementary school, like Dragon Ball Z). In high school I spent hours every weekend playing Halo with friends and discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> films which to this day are my favorite films of all time. I made so many friends through these shared passions, and still stay up late on Friday nights with many of them to play our favorite games and watch our favorite shows.</p>

     <h2><span>#3 Athletics</span></h2>
     <br>

     <br>
     <p>All throughout my childhood I remember playing sports. I must've tried nearly every sport there is at least once, minus snow sports as we didn't get a lot of that in the Western US. Around the time I was in 4th grade, our family moved to Southern California. I remember being quite nervous and unsure of the whole thing at first, as I already had great friends in Arizona and had to start all over. Luckily, I was invited to play basketball at recess by one of my classmates and instantly made many wonderful friends who I talk with to this day. In high school, I joined the track and cross country team and made many more great friends. They say sports are good for your health, but I've come to find they're just as good for your spirit. I enjoy running, climbing, and weightlifting mainly these days, but never turn down a good old fashioned 3 on 3.</p>

     <h2><span>#2 Helping</span></h2>
     <br>
     <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nTnQudH.jpg" alt="Image of Phil running" width="100%" class="center"></p>

     <br>
     <p>I really respect people who help others. When you help a person, it might seem small to you but it can mean the world to them. In my mind, helping doesn't always mean giving, it's more akin to assisting or empowering. One of the most rewarding jobs I've had throughout my career was teaching English in Japan, as I could help people face to face every day and see how much they appreciated it. Whether you directly see how your work helps someone, or do not, the feeling is still amazing knowing that you have made another person's life better. These days I enjoy finding ways to help people in my daily life and volunteering with larger organizations as well. I've found that many times in life we focus on ourselves, our perspectives, our problems, and overall what's best for us, and that can actually lead to a state of sadness more than happiness. There's nothing wrong with wanting the best life for yourself and working towards that. But it's also important to remember that the stronger you become, the more capable and responsible you are to help others. Not to mention, when you help someone you share in their happiness, making you both happier.</p>

     <h2><span>#1 Creating</span></h2>
     <br>

     <p>Here we are, my #1 passion. This one is a bit of a large category, but it's the best way I can describe it. I really love creating things. Writing, drawing, designing, and programming are some of the creative skills I most enjoy, but just the act of creating in itself, regardless of medium, is very rewarding. I'm not sure where that passion came from exactly, but I know that I've always had a pencil in my hand or a keyboard at my fingertips and enjoyed making things with them. This passion has also been shaped by other people's work that has had a profound impact on my own life. Those cartoons and games I loved as a kid all came from people who enjoyed making things and honed their craft to do so exceedingly well. I believe each person has their own gift to give to the world, in their own way. I look forward to doing so too as I continue to hone my skills.</p>

     <h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>
     <br>
     <p>That brings us to the end of this post. Thank you for spending time reading it, I hope that you've enjoyed it. It's been very fun for me reflecting on my passions and building this webpage to share them with you. I'll end by sharing one of my all-time favorite quotes, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>, that will hopefully encourage you to pursue your passions as well:</p>
   </div>
   <div>
     <p><em>"We have not even to risk the adventure alone for the heroes of all time have gone before us. The labyrinth is thoroughly known; we have only to follow the thread of the hero path. And where we had thought to find an abomination we shall find a God. And where we had thought to slay another we shall slay ourselves. Where we had thought to travel outwards we shall come to the center of our own existence. And where we had thought to be alone we shall be with all the world.‚Äù</em></p>
