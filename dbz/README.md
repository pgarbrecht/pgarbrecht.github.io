# Dragon Ball Z World Tournament
## Project Description
A Javascript, HTML, and CSS web browser game. Players can choose their characters and then each player takes three 15 second turns gathering ki by clicking the image that appears randomly on the page (think whack-a-mole). At the end of the time period, however much ki they gathered equals the power of their attack against the other player. At the end of the game, the person who dealt the most damage wins.

## 2. Approach Taken
I began by setting up the player classes and a rough outline of the screen with onClick events and DOM logic to choose your player and start the game. I proceeded to build out the rounds which are timed with setTimeout and use alerts in between each round. I finished up by adding animations, responsiveness so the game could be played on any device, and a music toggle switch. Latly I deployed the game through Github pages.

## 3. Unsolved Problems
I solved for all of my MVP user stories and stretch goals.

## 4. User Stories
* As a player, I need to choose my character and have their image be shown when playing
* As a player, I need to see the amount of ki I collect when playing to know my progress
* As a player, I need to be able to restart the game after winning or losing

### Stretch goal user stories
* As a player, I would also like the option to turn on or turn off music if interested
* As a player, I would also like to see a timer showing how much time is left in the turn
* As a player, I would also like to see my final score at the end of the game
