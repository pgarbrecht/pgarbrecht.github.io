## Project Description
General App Idea/Purpose: An application that can be used to create a list of items to buy for your shopping trip and then check off the items as you buy them at the store. 
<br />

## Models including field names and their datatypes
Will have an items.js file in models with the following schema: <br />
 const itemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ <br />
	name:  { type: String, required: true }, <br />
	notes: { type: String, required: false, default: 'Click edit item to add notes here' }, <br />
	image: { type: String, required: false, default: '/images/placeholder-item.png' }, <br />
}); <br />

 ## List of routes

 NEW /list/new allows to add new item via a form <br />
 POST /list/ saves new item to the database <br />
 SHOW /list/:id shows the details page for an item <br />
 EDIT /list/:id/edit give s form to edit existing item in database <br />

## User Stories
As a user, I am a busy person who needs to make sure I get everything I need for the week in one trip. As such, I need a way to both record what I will buy and keep track of when I've bought it. I value efficiency and speed, but still want the flexibility to add more detailed notes on items I will buy if I need to, like the exact brand name and color of soap my wife wants and what aisle to get it from at the store.

### MVP Goals
As a shopping trip planner, I want : 
- to be able to quickly add items to the list so that I save time
- to be able to update items and add more notes so that I can remember specific things
- to be able to see and remove my items from the same page so that I save time

### Extra addition added
As a shopping trip planner, I would also like : 
- to have a user account so I can plan items on my desktop then log in again on my phone to check them off (i.e my data persists between sessions I use the app).
